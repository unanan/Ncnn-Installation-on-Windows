# Ncnn-Installation-on-Windows
The steps and tips of installing the ncnn+protobuf envs on Windows.


----
#### Since the guide of installing and building Ncnn on Windows on the Official Site **can't** actually lead me correctly:

  https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn/wiki/cmake-VS2017-%E7%BC%96%E8%AF%91

#### I've found some other resources to build the Ncnn on my computer.

### 1. A Standalone Project

  https://github.com/liyemei/ncnn-windows-vs2013
  
This project doesn't rely on the envs. All the resources of the 3rd party are included in the project.

But it relys on the **VS201x v120 toolset**.
